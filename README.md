# eia.gov_Data_Pipeline

The goal of eia.gov_Data_Pipeline is to develop a data pipeline program that can extract data from API endpoints from eia.gov, Clean it, and Load it into a massive relational schema in MySQl. The project requires Python (Py libraries including Flask, SQLalchemy, and Pandas) MySql experience and an understanding of database design and data pipeline design. 

Tools includes:
  Jupyter Notebook
  MySQL workbench
  VsCode

Ai is and will be used.
Ai use includes:
  Writing HTML
  Logical review of code
  Helping breakdown lines of code
  Check relational logic in databse schema design

---THE PROJECT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION---

I begin the project in July 2025.
  I sifted through eia.gov and recorded nearly all API endpoints.
  I made a Jupyter script that extracted data and metadata from the API endpoints and stored it inside CSVs.
  Metadata is extracted into various CSV files.
  Metadata is used to design the 1.0 MySQL relational database schema.
  I then designed the data pipeline logic.
  
Update as of 8/28/25. 
  Data Pipeline is designed and database is also designed. 
  Psuedocode and Python coding is in progress.
  Relational database will need further review and normalization.
